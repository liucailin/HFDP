The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets class work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
the use of object composition to wrap the adaptee with altered interface. This approach has the added advantage that we can use an adapter class with any subclass of the adaptee.

the pattern binds the client to an interface, not an implementation; we could use several adapters, each converting a different backend set of classes. Or, we could add new implementation after the fact, as long as they adhere to the Target interface.
